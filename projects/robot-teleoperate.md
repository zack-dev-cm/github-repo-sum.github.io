title: Robot Teleoperate
---

In the era of humonoid robots, there is need to help robots with daily challenges. A service platform designed to remotely assist and control humanoid and service robots when they encounter challenges or become stuck in daily operations.  The idea is to provide a “robot rescue” on demand – a human operator can instantly connect to the robot via a simple interface, take control, and guide it through the problem. This ensures robots in homes, warehouses, or on delivery routes are never immobilized for long.
