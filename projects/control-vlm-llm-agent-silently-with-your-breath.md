title: Control VLM-LLM Agent Silently With Your Breath
---

**Description**: A system that allows users to start or stop a neural network agent using distinct breathing patterns (e.g., short exhalations to start, smooth exhalation to stop), rather than voice commands. After a calibration phase, it accurately detects commands from breathing sounds or even sniffles.

**Key Features**: Non-verbal AI control, pattern recognition of breathing acoustics.

**Tech Stack**: Audio processing, Neural Networks.
