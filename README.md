# Hey there!

I’m a deep learning and computer vision enthusiast who loves building things that *just might* make life easier—or at least more interesting. If you spot me squinting at a screen, I’m probably wrangling neural networks or figuring out how to make an AI agent tap around an Android screen all by itself. Here’s a quick peek at my journey and some of the projects I’ve built along the way.

## Some Projects & Creations

### 1. Android Remote Control with VLM AI Agents 
**“Hands-free” Android automation? Yes, please.**  
A custom Android app that captures screenshots and sends them to vision-language AI agents which figure out the next UI action—tap, swipe, or type.  
- **Real-Time**: Gets instructions from powerful server-based models.  
- **Use Cases**: Automated testing, daily phone tasks, or just messing around with new ways to control a device.

### 2. Control VLM-LLM Agent Silently With Your Breath
Start or stop the neural network with your breath. “Start listening” might be 2–3 short exhalations, while a smooth exhalation says “stop.” It’s all about recognizing **breathing** patterns, not your voice. After calibration (reading text aloud vs. silently), it learns to detect words from the sounds of breathing or sniffles alone.
