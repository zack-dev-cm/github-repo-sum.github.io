# Hey there!

I’m a deep learning and computer vision enthusiast who loves building things that *just might* make life easier—or at least more interesting. If you spot me squinting at a screen, I’m probably wrangling neural networks, tinkering with Chrome extensions, or figuring out how to make an AI agent tap around an Android screen all by itself. Here’s a quick peek at my journey and some of the projects I’ve built along the way.

---

## Who I Am (in a Nutshell)

- **Senior Deep Learning Engineer** with 5+ years of experience, focusing on everything from classification and segmentation to OCR and advanced multi-modal transformer models.  
- **Upwork Top Rated Plus** contractor, recognized in the top 1% of AI developers, with 100% Job Success and \$200K+ in total earnings.  
- **Mentor & Teacher**: I’ve led corporate programs, taught undergraduates the fundamentals of computer vision, and discovered I really enjoy sharing knowledge.  
- **Privacy & Security First**: I’m that person who doesn’t compromise on storing personal data. (My Chrome extensions do all their magic locally—no external servers, no sneaky data transfers!)

---

## Toolbelt & Tech Playground

- **Frameworks/Libraries**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, FastAI, OpenAI APIs, CLIP, Vision-Language foundation models.  
- **Languages**: Primarily Python, with supporting roles from Dart (Flutter), Kotlin, Swift, and C++.  
- **DevOps & Infra**: GCP, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud Build, Cloud Run, and a dash of ML Ops for good measure.  
- **Mobile & Embedded**: TFLite, CoreML, VisionOS for Apple Vision Pro.  

I’m always exploring new ways to optimize neural networks for everything from giant servers to your smartphone (or smart glasses, or anything in between).

## Some Projects & Creations

### Android Remote Control with VLM AI Agents 
**“Hands-free” Android automation? Yes, please.**  
A custom Android app that captures screenshots and sends them to vision-language AI agents which figure out the next UI action—tap, swipe, or type.  
- **Real-Time**: Gets instructions from powerful server-based models.  
- **Use Cases**: Automated testing, daily phone tasks, or just messing around with new ways to control a device.

### Control VLM-LLM Agent Silently With Your Breath
You can start or stop the neural network with your breath. For example, “start listening” might be 2–3 short exhalations, while a smooth exhalation says “stop.” When we speak, our breathing patterns change. This audio neural network doesn’t listen to your *voice* but rather the *breathing*. To calibrate it, you read some text aloud, then read it silently. The model learns how breath correlates to words—so eventually, it can recognize what you’re saying just by breathing or sniffling.
