I’m a deep learning and computer vision enthusiast who loves building things that *just might* make life easier—or at least more interesting. If you spot me squinting at a screen, I’m probably wrangling neural networks or figuring out how to make an AI agent tap around an Android screen all by itself. Here’s a quick peek at my journey and some of the projects I’ve built along the way.

## In a Nutshell

- **Senior Deep Learning Engineer** with 5+ years of experience, focusing on everything from classification and segmentation to OCR and multi-modal transformer reasoning models.  
- **Upwork Top Rated Plus** contractor, recognized in the top 1% of AI developers, with 100% Job Success.  
- **Mentor & Teacher**: I’ve led corporate programs, taught undergraduates the fundamentals of computer vision, and discovered I really enjoy sharing knowledge.

## Toolbelt & Tech Playground

- **Frameworks/Libraries**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, FastAI, OpenAI APIs, CLIP, Vision-Language foundation models.  
- **Languages**: Primarily Python, with supporting roles from Dart (Flutter), Kotlin/Java, Swift, and C++.  
- **DevOps & Infra**: GCP, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud Build, Cloud Run, and a dash of ML Ops for good measure.

### 1. Android Remote Control with VLM AI Agents
**“Hands-free” Android automation? Yes, please.**  
A custom Android app that captures screenshots and sends them to vision-language AI agents which determine the next UI action—tap, swipe, or type.  
- **Real-Time**: Receives instructions from powerful server-based models.  
- **Use Cases**: Automated testing, daily phone tasks, or exploring novel ways to control a device.

### 2. Control VLM-LLM Agent Silently With Your Breath
Start or stop the neural network with your breath. “Start listening” might be 2–3 short exhalations, while a smooth exhalation says “stop.” It’s all about recognizing **breathing** patterns, not your voice. After calibration (reading text aloud vs. silently), it learns to detect words from the sounds of breathing or even sniffles.

### 3. Create, Chat & AR Experience with AI-Character (Text2Room)
**Image & Video Generation • Inpainting • TryOn • Reasoning & More**  
Spin up an AI “character,” style them, dress them up, chat via Telegram, or even place them in your living room! Ideal for marketing campaigns, creative collaborations, or simply exploring next-gen generative AI.
