I’m a deep learning and computer vision enthusiast who loves building things that *just might* make life easier—or at least more interesting. If you spot me squinting at a screen, I’m probably wrangling neural networks or figuring out how to make an AI agent tap around an Android screen all by itself. Here’s a quick peek at my journey and some of the projects I’ve built along the way.

### 1. Android Remote Control with VLM AI Agents
**“Hands-free” Android automation? Yes, please.**  
A custom Android app that captures screenshots and sends them to vision-language AI agents which determine the next UI action—tap, swipe, or type.  
- **Real-Time**: Receives instructions from powerful server-based models.  
- **Use Cases**: Automated testing, daily phone tasks, or exploring novel ways to control a device.

### 2. Control VLM-LLM Agent Silently With Your Breath
Start or stop the neural network with your breath. “Start listening” might be 2–3 short exhalations, while a smooth exhalation says “stop.” It’s all about recognizing **breathing** patterns, not your voice. After calibration (reading text aloud vs. silently), it learns to detect words from the sounds of breathing or even sniffles.

### 14. Task Zavod – Micro-Task Marketplace
Build, validate, and **pay out micro-tasks automatically**.
https://food-n-bot-dev-1095464065298.us-central1.run.app/task_zavod
| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
|--------|--------|
| **Stack** | Tornado (Web + SSE) · SQLite · OpenAI  · VLM · Telegram Bot API |
| **Problem** | Crowdsourcing routine QA jobs is fragile: you need clear instructions, proof, and fast payout. |
| **Solution** | **Task Zavod** lets a business user drop free-form text → VLM converts it to a structured task; workers pick it up in a web feed *or* via Telegram bot, upload results, and an VLM auto-approves/denies. |
| **Cool bits** | *Live* status polling, autopayment with VLM

### 15. Trending Prompts Feed
https://food-n-bot-dev-1095464065298.us-central1.run.app
A **Reddit-style board for viral prompts**—built on Tornado backend.

* **Upvote / Downvote ranking** with real-time *trending* score.  
* **Integration with autocomplete for ChatGPT|Deepseek|AIStudio Navigator** + client-side sort (Trending 🔥 / Latest ✨).  

> ✨ **Why it matters:** it was the tiny experiment that convinced me “prompt engineering” can be *crowd-sourced*. The feature has since been ported into my ChatGPT|Deepseek|AIStudio Navigator extension.
