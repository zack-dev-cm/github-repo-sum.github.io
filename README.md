# Hey there! 

I’m a deep learning and computer vision enthusiast who loves building things that *just might* make life easier—or at least more interesting. If you spot me squinting at a screen, I’m probably wrangling neural networks, tinkering with Chrome extensions, or figuring out how to make an AI agent tap around an Android screen all by itself. Here’s a quick peek at my journey and the things I’ve built along the way.

## Who I Am (in a Nutshell)

- **Senior Deep Learning Engineer** with 5+ years of experience, focusing on everything from classification and segmentation to OCR and advanced multi-modal transformer models.  
- **Upwork Top Rated Plus** contractor, recognized in the top 1% of AI developers, with 100% Job Success and \$200K+ in total earnings.  
- **Mentor & Teacher**: I’ve led corporate programs, taught undergraduates the fundamentals of computer vision, and discovered I really enjoy sharing knowledge.  
- **Privacy & Security First**: I’m that person who doesn’t compromise on storing personal data. (My Chrome extensions do all their magic locally—no external servers, no sneaky data transfers!)

## Toolbelt & Tech Playground

- **Frameworks/Libraries**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, FastAI, OpenAI APIs, CLIP, Vision-Language foundation models.  
- **Languages**: Primarily Python, with supporting roles from Dart (Flutter), Kotlin, Swift, and C++.  
- **DevOps & Infra**: GCP, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud Build, Cloud Run, and a dash of ML Ops for good measure.  
- **Mobile & Embedded**: TFLite, CoreML, VisionOS for Apple Vision Pro.  

I’m always exploring new ways to optimize neural networks for everything from giant servers to your smartphone (or smart glasses, or anything in between).

## Some Projects & Creations

### Android Remote Control with VLM AI Agents. Android: Become Human.
**“Hands-free” Android automation? Yes, please.**  
A custom Android app that captures screenshots and sends them to vision-language AI agents which figure out the next UI action—tap, swipe, or type.  
- **Real-Time**: Gets instructions from powerful server-based models.  
- **Use Cases**: Automated testing, daily phone tasks, or just messing around with new ways to control a device.

### Create and chat. Create your AI fashion model, pokemon or whatever you like, dress or chat in telegram 
-- **Image & Video generation. Inpainting. Reasoning and more**

### Food Recognition App
**When you want your phone to know what’s for dinner**  
AI app that identifies food items (packaged or fresh) and performs OCR on labels.
- **Nutritional Info**: Extract brand names, nutrient data, and portion sizes.  
- **Works in Real-Time**: Over 90% accuracy optimized for GPU and CPU inference.  
- **Supports iOS & Android**: Because who doesn't want cross-platform recognition?

### Python Library: AutoToloka (Multi-Modal Neural Networks Integration)
**Speedy dataset prep & crowdsourcing**  
AutoToloka is a Python library to help set up and validate datasets, using interactive segmentation and multi-modal networks under the hood.  
- **Reduces Labeling Costs**: Automates a chunk of the manual labeling process.  
- **Scalable**: Integrates easily with bigger pipeline tools, containerized deployments, and major cloud platforms.

### Python Library: shiftlab-ocr 
SHIFT OCR is a library for handwriting text segmentation and character recognition.
pip install shiftlab-ocr

### Face Antispoofing & Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models
**Because the camera can be tricked—sometimes**  
I experiment with CLIP and other multi-modal setups to detect spoofing in face authentication systems, bridging text-image embeddings and more advanced, specialized neural networks.

### GitHub Repo Summarizer (Chrome Extension)
**Speed-read your repositories**  
This extension uses your locally stored GitHub personal access token to fetch and summarize code structure—no servers involved.  
- **No Third-Party Sharing**: Token stays on your device.  
- **Auto Summaries**: Quickly see how a repo is organized, from directories to major code files.

### ChatGPT Scrollbar (Chrome Extension)
**Tired of scrolling forever through ChatGPT’s conversation feed?**  
I was too! So I built a nifty extension that adds a navigable scrollbar with clickable dashes for quick jumps. Simple but oh-so-handy.  
- **Local-Only Storage**: No external pings or data collection.  
- **Auto-Hide**: Keeps your screen tidy when you don’t need it.
